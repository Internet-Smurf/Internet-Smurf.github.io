<h1>Hello World!</h1>

I am learning <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">Spezialisierung Web Design for Everybody</a> on coursera.org. Now Colleen (the teacher) asked her participants to create a first page - and this is, what I do.

<br>

I'm in the first part: "Introduction to HTML" close to the end of week 3.

<br>
<br>

As I already know a little bit  
&nbsp;
<i class="fas fa-grin-beam"></i>
&nbsp;
of HTML, I was able to process one "week" of the course on one day.


Next will be CSS - I don't know much about that - but at the end of the course I will!

This is a picture of our dog "Lenny" about three years ago, the year, we had to say good bye to him. This is in the beginning of 2017, when we had <b>a lot of snow</b> and I had to free our car parking space. Lenny always wanted to be with us, so this was no problem, because he did not run away. And he "talked" to us, especially to my wife; but here he just looks like: "What are you going to do with the square thing in front of your face?"

<br>

We were told to create sub-pages. I will skip this, I only want to put some of the features into this page, that Colleen tought us.

<br>
<br>

<font size=+1>
I think, that's it for now. Bye!
